            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            This is the final project for Flatiron School's prework. This is the first website that I am building from scratch. 
            <h3>What I learned the basics of so far:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I still need to learn:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1,000 details about the above plus everything else in the world of coding!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id = "info">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a trilingual household, speaking German, French, and English every day. I have had a love for languages since I can remember. I learned Spanish in high school and then college because I wanted to learn yet another language. Now, I am starting my journey learning the language of code. I am looking forward to the challenge, the problem solving, and the intricate puzzles that coding represents. Until now, I have worked mostly in education, teaching students anywhere from Kindergarden all the way to undergraduates in college. I have taught in outdoor education, in the classroom, and in the field doing research. I want to continue the journey in education for myself through Flatiron School, and then I hope to use my skills to connect the field of education and computer programming.
